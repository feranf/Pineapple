# Pineapple language
This is a language that focuses on:
- Readability
- Typability
- Type safety
- Easy module import/export
- Ability to differentiate pure and impure code (like Haskell)
- List comprehension
- High order function (map, filter, reduce)

This language aims to allow developers to write readable code easily and to write library that have readable API. 

Also, it focuses on typability, means weird symbols that are hard to type will be avoided as much as possible.

However, readability will be preferred first when contradicting situation happens.
