# The Pineapple Language

Pineapple is a programming language designed for humans.

It aims to reduces WTFs from programmers.

Write clean code easily without frying your brain.

Create beautiful and elegant API without hacking.

Let others understand what you wrote.

No more object-orientated programming.

Say good bye to debugging hell.

What you see is what you get.

Say Hello to Pineapple.
