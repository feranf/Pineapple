# A Basic Pineapple Program
Every Pineapple program is executed via the `().main` method.  
For example,
```py
def ().main
    'hello world'.show
    'bye'.show
```

!!! info "Note"
    Indentation(tab) is necessary. If you are using spaces, it must be 4 spaces per tab.

Also, by default, the [Prelude library](https://github.com/wongjiahau/Pineapple/tree/master/src/pinelib/prelude) will be loaded.
