# Branching and Loop
It will be like python style.

## If-else
```python
if he isSmart  and  he isNerdy
    print "He is a programmer."
elif he isHot
    print "OMG"
else 
    print "..."
```

## Loop
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple']

foreach i in [0 to (fruits length - 1)]
    -> print fruits[i]


foreach fruit in fruits
    -> print fruit

var i = 0
while i < fruits length
    -> print fruits[i]
    i++
```
